# Getting Started with GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions is a powerful tool for automating software workflows directly in your GitHub repository. It allows you to build, test, and deploy your code right from GitHub.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:
- A GitHub account
- A repository where you want to set up GitHub Actions

## Creating Your First GitHub Action

1. **Navigate to Your Repository**: Go to the repository where you want to create the GitHub Action.
2. **Create a Workflow File**: In your repository, create a new directory named `.github/workflows`. Inside this directory, create a new file with a `.yml` extension (e.g., `main.yml`).
3. **Define Your Workflow**: Open the `.yml` file and define your workflow. Here is an example of a simple workflow that runs on every push to the repository:

    ```yaml
    name: CI

    on: [push]

    jobs:
      build:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest

        steps:
        - name: Checkout code
          uses: actions/checkout@v2

        - name: Set up Node.js
          uses: actions/setup-node@v2
          with:
            node-version: '14'

        - name: Install dependencies
          run: npm install

        - name: Run tests
          run: npm test
    ```

4. **Commit and Push**: Commit your changes and push them to your repository. GitHub Actions will automatically run the workflow you defined.

## Monitoring Your Workflow

After pushing your changes, you can monitor the progress of your workflow:
- Go to the "Actions" tab in your repository.
- Select the workflow run you want to view.

## Conclusion

GitHub Actions simplifies the process of automating your development workflows. By following the steps above, you can set up your first GitHub Action and start automating tasks in your repository.

For more information, refer to the [GitHub Actions documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions).
